# Examples

Each subdirectory offers a different example of developing an application on top of the Roundtable architecture. In truth, these examples also serve as tests for the application, since the vast majority of the code is nigh-untestable, especially in an integrated way.

Each example provides a README detailing how to run that specific example, as well as a brief motivation of what the example will achieve.

In general, you must ensure that the root Makefile has been executed appropriately before running these examples. From the root of this repo, run: `make git_submodule_init git_submodule_build`.
