// An abstraction of a lister to audio input.
// Somewhat analogous to a peer â€” this struct cares about receiving data from the input device,
// and may be invalidated at some point (e.g. disconnected or closed).
//
// We send data to a listener over the data channel, and use the
// context (which has a cancel function held by the peer) to check if the
// listener is invalidated.
//
// A list of listeners is held by the AudioManager, and new input data
// is fed to each listener
//
// When invalidated, the listener is removed from the listener list.
